Some important things need to remember:
1. Very important!!!!!
   Every time testing signup and edit profile, need change newusername,newemail in signupspec and 
   username,email_old and email_new in editprofilespec to a never registered one.
2. a2 depends on account registere in a1;
3. There are two id=locations <h> in both loginpage and homepage's html file.
   For loginpage, it = "-- share your beautiful life", for homepage, it = "Welcome to Gatorbook!",
   so error type expect "-- share ..." to be "Welcome to ..." means you are not logged in, but you
   were expected to.
4. navigateToProfilePageFromHome() function in "editprofile" directly routes to profile page using
   path, so after log in need to wait for a while, for system to recognize user, and then 
   route to profile using path can work(otherwise the effect same to route to profile without login)
5. Be careful to use "clickbtnInMenu" function in signup and editprofile. 
   When error type: wait for 11s, cannot get by(.css(XXX)), which means you expect to route to btninMenu
   page to get that element, but you were not route to there, so cannot get by(.css(XXX))

Debug experience:
1. When you see expect XX but get undefined, check if you use this.variable or not, should remove "this"
2. When you see cannot find by(.css(XXX)), first maybe you element by a wrong name, or else you are not
   in the page where that element exists.
